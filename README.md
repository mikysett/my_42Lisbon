# 42Lisbon - Exercises with solutions

This is a work in progress of my exercises in 42 School. All the modules exept the last are finished and usually moulinette approuved, many of them have also all or some bonuses done.

I hope reading this code will be helpful to have ideas and find solutions, still please remember there is no guarantees this code will work correctly and many of the solutions I've chosen are for sure not the best possible ones.

## Submodules refactoring

Now each project has his own repo so it's not necessary to clone everything for just one project.
